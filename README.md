# pockdeng
Pockdeng is my mini-project on computer-programming class in Thai-German Pre-Engineering School.
My teacher requirements is a project that "use" Python, But I'm not good at Python now then I use Python as webserver and serve my app that written in html and javascript communicate with Python based Backend. All of this I'm using only built-in module because my teacher won't install any package on his mechine.(The cards import from SVG Cards lib)
